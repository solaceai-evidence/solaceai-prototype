feat: Add GPU-accelerated ONNX reranker with docker-compose integration

- Add simple_onnx_service.py with Optimum ONNX model support
- Implement dual API compatibility (passages/documents fields)
- Configure docker-compose with GPU reranker service  
- Fix RemoteReranker timeout and service discovery
- Add health checks and proper error handling
- Successfully tested with 241-passage climate emergency query

Performance improvements:
- ONNX model loading with accuracy-focused configuration
- Container networking and service discovery
- Increased timeout to 300s for large document batches
- Fallback to CrossEncoder if ONNX fails

Integration validation:
- All docker containers healthy
- GPU reranker service responding  
- End-to-end query processing working
- 241 passages sent for reranking successfully
